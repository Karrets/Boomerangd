# Boomerang
A linux daemon used to easily define port and packet rules in a simple config file!

## Credits!
I found this guide to be very helpful, as this was my first time writing a daemon.
https://nullraum.net/how-to-create-a-daemon-in-c/

In addition, thanks to the Meson Build Project for making using c/++ not the worst thing in the world.
(Looking at you cmake...)

## Config Files:
Not yet determined. This program is in its infancy. When I have everything set up however,
I'll make some nice docs in GitHub for you when this utility is any good.

## Me
If you get any use out of this project, or think it could be useful, let me know. Make a GitHub issue.
Any interaction with the project shows you care and that I should continue working on it.
