A linux daemon used to easily define port and packet rules in a simple config file!

## Credits!
I found [this](https://nullraum.net/how-to-create-a-daemon-in-c/)
guide to be very helpful, as this was my first time writing a daemon.


Thank you to the people who develop the *libpcap* C library, so I don't lose
my mind by trying to do socket programming with no abstractions. And to [this](https://www.devdungeon.com/content/using-libpcap-c)
tutorial for helping me use it!

In addition, thanks to the *Meson Build* Project for making using C/++ not the worst thing in the world.
(Looking at you CMAKE...)

## Config Files:
Not yet determined. This program is in its infancy. When I have everything set up however,
I'll make some nice docs in GitHub for you when this utility is any good.

## Me
If you get any use out of this project, or think it could be useful, let me know. Make a GitHub issue.
Any interaction with the project shows you care and that I should continue working on it.
